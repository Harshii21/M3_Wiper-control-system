A Wiper Speed Control System Controls the operational speed of the wiper in accordance with the rain condition. This Wiper Speed Control System is used in all
types of vehicles the main purpose is to clean the rain air drops present in front screen of the vehicles. It is very difficult to drive the vehicles in rain condition 
so in this case we will use wipers to clean the front screen of vehicles which is mirror so that we can drive the vehicles even in rain.

The automated rain wiper system is used to detect rainfall and activate automobile automatic rain wiper without drivers to focus on their primary task of driving.
The distraction eliminated with the development of this product is the manual adjustment of windshield wipers when driving. The few seconds that a driver takes their 
attention off the road to adjust a knob while driving in poor weather conditions could potentially lead to a car accidents.If we apply sensor on glass which senses 
the act of sprinkling water,by automation the wiper will be operating automatically. When the water hits the sensor,it will send signal to the system thus moving 
the wiper motor. once the wiper did not detect any water,the wiper will stop.
