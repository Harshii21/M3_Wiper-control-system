# ABSTRACT
 A wiper is a necessary component that cleans raindrops or any other liquid off the vehicle's windscreen. The prior system required manual wiper activation,
 by changing the frequency  As its results the operation of bringing up the wiper speed is varied . The project's goals are to improve ageing cars' systems 
 by giving automated transmission.wiping system, to improve the system by incorporating a sensor and actuator, and to create a simple software that would
 completely operate with the system.the framework This proposed wiper system's principle is comparable to those of other existing conventional wipers. 
 Despite the fact that. This system will be upgraded to an automatic control system using a Peripheral Interface to remove water from the windscreen.
